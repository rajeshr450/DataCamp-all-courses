You're getting very good at using lambda functions! Here's one more function to add to your repertoire of skills. The reduce() function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike map() and filter(), returns a single value as a result. To use reduce(), you must import it from the functools module.

Remember gibberish() from a few exercises back?

# Define gibberish
def gibberish(*args):
    """Concatenate strings in *args together."""
    hodgepodge = ''
    for word in args:
        hodgepodge += word
    return hodgepodge
gibberish() simply takes a list of strings as an argument and returns, as a single-value result, the concatenation of all of these strings. In this exercise, you will replicate this functionality by using reduce() and a lambda function that concatenates strings together.

# Import reduce from functools
from functools import reduce

# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'brandon', 'rickon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
result = reduce(lambda item1, item2 : item1 + item2, stark)

# Print the result
print(result)
